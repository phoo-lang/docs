<p>This page serves as a quick introduction to the programming language Phoo and how to write code in it. While Phoo is definitely new, it is a full-featured language, and once the hurdle of reverse Polish notation is overcome, Phoo code is quick and rewarding.</p>
<p><em>This tutorial is adapted in part from the tutorial in</em> <a href="https://github.com/GordonCharlton/Quackery/blob/main/The%20Book%20of%20Quackery.pdf">The Book of Quackery</a>, <em>by Gordon Charlton, due to the fact that Phoo is adapted in part from Quackery.</em></p>

<h2 id="getting-started">Getting Started</h2>
<p>Phoo is not yet distributed as an executable file. However, a simple online shell has been jimmied up at <a href="https://phoo-lang.github.io/">https://phoo-lang.github.io/</a>, so head over there to try it out. You should get something like this:</p>
<pre><code class="language-txt">Welcome to Phoo.
Version 0.2.0 (e03dead)
Shell at 783f999
Strict mode is ON
Press Shift+Enter for multiple lines.
(0)--&gt; 
</code></pre>
<p>At the prompt, you type your code, and the Phoo machine evaluates it and puts the results on the stack.</p>
<p>Alternatively, for the code here, you can hover over the box and click &ldquo;Run this code&rdquo; at the top right, which will launch the aforementioned online shell and trigger it to run that code as if you pasted it into the first prompt.</p>
<h2 id="phoo-says-hello-world">Phoo Says Hello World</h2>
<p>The obligatory first task for any programming language is to print &ldquo;Hello, World!&rdquo;. The code to accomplish that in Phoo is this:</p>
<pre><code class="language-phoo">$ &quot;Hello World!&quot; echo
</code></pre>
<p>Now how did Phoo do that? The answer is not so simple, and hopefully by the end of this tutorial, you should be able to answer that question.</p>
<p>The next usual task for a programming language is basic arithmetic. So, we ask Phoo, what is 2+2?</p>
<pre><code class="language-phoo">2+2
</code></pre>
<p>Try it out. Back? Good. Got an error? Even better. The first rule of Phoo is that separate words (such as &ldquo;2&rdquo; and &ldquo;+&rdquo;) must have whitespace between. So we try again:</p>
<pre><code class="language-phoo">2 + 2
</code></pre>
<p>Did you still get an error? That is to be expected as well. Phoo is categorized as a concatenative programming language, which means that the operands must come before the operation. This is also known as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reverse_Polish_notation">reverse Polish notation</a>, which utilizes a stack. Each operand is pushed to the stack, and operators pop the operands back off the stack and push the result. So we must rearrange:</p>
<pre><code class="language-phoo">2 2 +
</code></pre>
<p>Hooray! It worked. The twos were pushed onto the stack and <code>+</code> added them, leaving the answer, 4, on the stack.</p>
