<p>This page serves as a quick introduction to the programming language Phoo and how to write code in it. While Phoo is definitely new, it is a full-featured language, and once the hurdle of reverse Polish notation is overcome, Phoo code is quick and rewarding.</p>
<p><em>This tutorial is adapted in part from the tutorial in</em> <a href="https://github.com/GordonCharlton/Quackery/blob/main/The%20Book%20of%20Quackery.pdf">The Book of Quackery</a>, <em>by Gordon Charlton, due to the fact that Phoo is adapted in part from Quackery.</em></p>

<h2 id="getting-started">Getting Started</h2>
<p>Phoo is not yet distributed as an executable file. However, a simple online shell has been jimmied up at <a href="https://phoo-lang.github.io/">https://phoo-lang.github.io/</a>, so head over there to try it out. You should get something like this:</p>
<pre><code>Welcome to Phoo.
Version 0.2.0 (e03dead)
Shell at 783f999
Strict mode is ON
Press Shift+Enter for multiple lines.
(0)--&gt; 
</code></pre>
<p>At the prompt, you type your code, and the Phoo machine evaluates it and puts the results on the stack.</p>
<p>Alternatively, for the code here, you can hover over the box and click &ldquo;Run this code&rdquo; at the top right, which will launch the aforementioned online shell and trigger it to run that code as if you pasted it into the first prompt.</p>
<h2 id="phoo-says-hello-world">Phoo Says Hello World</h2>
<p>The obligatory first task for any programming language is to print &ldquo;Hello, World!&rdquo;. The code to accomplish that in Phoo is this:</p>
<pre><code class="language-phoo">$ &quot;Hello, World!&quot; echo
</code></pre>
<p>Now how did Phoo do that? The answer is not so simple, and hopefully by the end of this tutorial, you should be able to answer that question.</p>
<p>The next usual task for a programming language is basic arithmetic. So, we ask Phoo, what is 2+2?</p>
<pre><code class="language-phoo">2+2
</code></pre>
<p>Try it out. Back? Good. Got an error? Even better. The first rule of Phoo is that separate words (such as &ldquo;2&rdquo; and &ldquo;+&rdquo;) must have whitespace between. So we try again:</p>
<pre><code class="language-phoo">2 + 2
</code></pre>
<p>Did you still get an error? That is to be expected as well. Phoo is categorized as a concatenative programming language, which means that the operands must come before the operation. This is also known as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reverse_Polish_notation">reverse Polish notation</a>, which utilizes a stack. Each operand is pushed to the stack, and operators pop the operands back off the stack and push the result. So we must rearrange:</p>
<pre><code class="language-phoo">2 2 +
</code></pre>
<p>Hooray! It worked. The twos were pushed onto the stack and <code class="language-phoo highlight">+</code> added them, leaving the answer, 4, on the stack.</p>
<p>For a more concrete example on how the stack works, the usual in-fix expression <code>(3*4)+(5*6)</code> translates in reverse-Polish notation to <code>3 4 + 5 6 + *</code>. I have inserted <code class="language-phoo highlight">stacksize pack dup dip unpack echostack</code> (which prints out the stack without altering it) after every word in the expression below, to visualize what is going on to and off of the stack:</p>
<pre><code class="language-phoo">3 stacksize pack dup dip unpack echostack
4 stacksize pack dup dip unpack echostack
* stacksize pack dup dip unpack echostack
5 stacksize pack dup dip unpack echostack
6 stacksize pack dup dip unpack echostack
* stacksize pack dup dip unpack echostack
+
</code></pre>
<p>Here&rsquo;s what happens, line by line:</p>
<ol>
<li>3 is pushed to the stack.</li>
<li>4 is pushed to the stack.</li>
<li><code class="language-phoo highlight">*</code> multiplies the two and leaves 12 on the stack.</li>
<li>5 is pushed to the stack.</li>
<li>6 is pushed to the stack.</li>
<li><code class="language-phoo highlight">*</code> multiples the 5 and 6, leaving 30, and the 12 is not touched.</li>
<li><code class="language-phoo highlight">+</code> adds the 12 and 30, resulting in 42 for the entire expression.</li>
</ol>
<p>While this may seem like a lousy way to put 42 on the stack, not every input in an expression is going to be hard-coded. In most every other case, it&rsquo;s not going to be 3, it&rsquo;s going to be some data taken from elsewhere that needs to be processed. A thourough understanding of stack-based post-fix arithmetic is essential to programming in Phoo.</p>
<p>At this point we have now seen examples of words. Words are simply any sequence of non-whitespace characters that Phoo recognizes &mdash; such as <code class="language-phoo highlight">echo</code> and <code class="language-phoo highlight">+</code>. To see a list of all the words available to you, type <code class="language-phoo highlight">dir</code> at the prompt and it will put a long list of strings on the stack.</p>
<p>We have also seen examples of literals. A literal is special type of word that simply represents a primitive value, such as <code class="language-phoo highlight">5</code>. Literals are described by a regular expression, and the builtin library has several regular expressions for different number formats, among others.</p>
<p>Lastly, we have seen an example of a macro. The macro <code class="language-phoo highlight">$</code> handles the compilation of strings. Macros are not limited to one word&rsquo;s worth as are literals &ndash; they can use the entirety of the source string after them, and modify the code behind them. I won&rsquo;t be getting into macros in too much depth here, but the <a href="internals.html#compilation">Internals document</a> has some good explanations of how macros and literals are recognized and interpreted by the Phoo compiler.</p>
<h2 id="sneaky-sneaky-sub-arrays">Sneaky Sneaky Sub-Arrays</h2>
<p>The final construct (not seen so far) is simply a sub-array. These are created using the macros <code class="language-phoo highlight">do</code>/<code class="language-phoo highlight">[</code> and <code class="language-phoo highlight">end</code>/<code class="language-phoo highlight">]</code>. Sub-arrays are the core of program stucture, and have a few caveats.</p>
<div class="admonition note">
<p class="admonition-title">Side note on code style</p>
<p><code class="language-phoo highlight">do</code> and <code class="language-phoo highlight">[</code> (and likewise <code class="language-phoo highlight">end</code> and <code class="language-phoo highlight">]</code>) are interchangeable and can be chosen freely between without any affect on program speed. In fact, they are actually the <a href="https://github.com/phoo-lang/phoo/blob/e03dead92b045b539fdbeb2ea68e610d9affa973/lib/_builtins.js#L114-L115">same</a> <a href="https://github.com/phoo-lang/phoo/blob/e03dead92b045b539fdbeb2ea68e610d9affa973/lib/_builtins.js#L134-L135">functions</a> under the hood. The convention is to use <code class="language-phoo highlight">do</code>/<code class="language-phoo highlight">end</code> when enclosing a block of code that will just be run verbatim, and <code class="language-phoo highlight">[</code>/<code class="language-phoo highlight">]</code> when enclosing a sub-array that will be interpreted as data or as a lambda partial that will have more code concatenated into it. Phoo also doesn&rsquo;t care if you open an array with <code class="language-phoo highlight">[</code> and close it with <code class="language-phoo highlight">end</code> &ndash; although if I ever get around to writing a Phoo linter, it <em>will</em> complain if you do this!</p>
</div>
<p>The first caveat of sub-arrays is that sub-arrays are always assumed to be blocks of <em>code</em>, not <em>data</em>, and are run unless you tell Phoo otherwise. Consider this array:</p>
<pre><code class="language-phoo">[ 1 2 3 4 5 ]
</code></pre>
<p>If you run this, the output will be a little misleading. The resultant stack printout says <code>Stack: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]</code> &ndash; and if you say &ldquo;Yes! The brackets worked!&rdquo; you&rsquo;d be wrong. Leave that shell window open and type <code class="language-phoo highlight">drop</code> to remove the top (righmost) item of the stack. You should get <code>Stack: [1, 2, 3, 4]</code>.</p>
<p>Now why was the last item of the array taken out? The answer is that the numbers were never in an array. Phoo interpreted the sub-array as a block of code, jumped into it, and &ldquo;executed&rdquo; 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, which being literals, simply pushed their value to the stack.</p>
<p>The correct way to put an array on the stack is with the word <code class="language-phoo highlight">'</code> (quote), like so:</p>
<pre><code class="language-phoo">' [ 1 2 3 4 5 ]
</code></pre>
<p>The output from this should be <code>Stack: [[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]]</code>, indicating that there is one array (inner set of brackets) on the stack (outer set of brackets). <code class="language-phoo highlight">drop</code> here and you&rsquo;ll wind up with <code>Stack empty.</code>, indicating that there was only one item on the stack.</p>
<h2 id="look-both-ways-before-you-cross">Look Both Ways Before You Cross</h2>
<p>The word <code class="language-phoo highlight">'</code> is the simplest of a family of words known as &ldquo;lookahead&rdquo; words. Lookahead here means that it takes the item ahead of it (whatever it is) and operates on it, instead of allowing Phoo to run it normally. The behavior of <code class="language-phoo highlight">'</code> is pretty mundane &ndash; it does nothing but put the item on the stack. However, as shown above, this is useful to prevent Phoo from running things it shouldn&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>Another word that uses lookahead is <code class="language-phoo highlight">to</code>. <code class="language-phoo highlight">to</code> is used to define a new word so that Phoo will understand it. <code class="language-phoo highlight">to</code> actually utilizes lookahead twice &ndash; the first item after it is the new name for the word being defined, and the second item is the definition. Here&rsquo;s a nicely-formatted example:</p>
<pre><code class="language-phoo">to hello do
    $ &quot;Hello, World!&quot; echo
end
</code></pre>
<p>Run that in the shell and nothing prints out &ndash; indicating that the code inside the <code class="language-phoo highlight">do</code>&hellip;<code class="language-phoo highlight">end</code> wasn&rsquo;t run (which, if it had been, would print out <code>Hello, World!</code>). But something did happen &ndash; type <code class="language-phoo highlight">hello</code> at the prompt (autocomplete may help you), and you will be greeted by <code>Hello, World!</code>.</p>
<p>What we&rsquo;ve done here is define a new word, <code class="language-phoo highlight">hello</code>, that when run, prints <code>Hello, World!</code>. It&rsquo;s as simple as that. Type <code class="language-phoo highlight">hello hello</code> and you will get <code>Hello, World!</code> twice.</p>
<p>Now, not every word that uses lookahead will <em>only</em> use lookahead as does <code class="language-phoo highlight">to</code> &ndash; it is perfectly legal for a word to take some inputs from the stack and others as lokahead, and process them all to produce a result. An example of this is <code class="language-phoo highlight">times</code>, the looping word. It takes an item from the stack (a number, N) and an item ahead (a block of code), and runs the lookahead block N times. Here&rsquo;s an example:</p>
<pre><code class="language-phoo">10 times do
    $ &quot;Looping!&quot; echo
end
</code></pre>
<h2 id="yes-everything-is-or-can-be-a-stack">Yes, Everything Is (or Can Be) a Stack</h2>
<p>By now you should be familiar with the fact that Phoo utilizes a stack for manipulating values. This is the main &ldquo;work&rdquo; stack &ndash; but it&rsquo;s not the only stack. The special word <code class="language-phoo highlight">stack</code>, when placed at the front of a definition, turns the definition from a function that runs its code into an ancillary stack that stores data in its elements. For example,</p>
<pre><code class="language-phoo">to mystack [ stack 0 1 2 ]
</code></pre>
<p>This creates an ancillary stack called <code class="language-phoo highlight">mystack</code> with the elements 0, 1, and 2 on it to start with. Now with a stack, you can write such things as <code class="language-phoo highlight">1 mystack put</code> to push another 1 onto <code class="language-phoo highlight">mystack</code>, or <code class="language-phoo highlight">mystack take</code> to pop the top item of <code class="language-phoo highlight">mystack</code> and leave it on the main work stack. The builtin words have their own stacks that they use for various purposes here and there. Ancillary stacks act a lot like local variables, allowing you to put it on a separate stack for safe keeping while you do stuff with other values, without cluttering the main stack and jumbling your program with stack-manipulating words, and forgetting where values are on the stack.</p>
<p>How this is actually accomplished is that when <code class="language-phoo highlight">stack</code> is run, it pushes a reference to the sub-array it is sitting in to the work stack, and skips everything else after it. Now, interestingly, <code class="language-phoo highlight">stack</code> does <strong>not</strong> use the lookahead operator.</p>
<p>The Phoo interpreter has another stack as well as the work stack, which it uses to remember where in an outer array it is executing when it jumps into a sub-array, called the <em>return stack</em>. This stack can be manipulated by words to redirect the instruction pointer when it jumps back out of the sub-array.</p>
<p>What actually goes on with the return stack is that when Phoo tries to execute a sub-array, it &ldquo;jumps in&rdquo; to the array by pushing the old outer array and pointer index onto the return stack, and then starting back again from zero in the sub-array as though nothing had happened.</p>
<p>When Phoo gets to the end of the sub-array, it blindly &ldquo;jumps out,&rdquo; using whatever old array and pointer there was on top of the return stack. If the stack item had been modified in the meantime, the instruction pointer won&rsquo;t necessarially come back to where it had left off.</p>
<p>In fact, this is exactly how structured control flow is acheived in Phoo.</p>
<h2 id="phoo-messes-itself-up-well-not-really">Phoo Messes Itself Up (well, not really)</h2>
<p>Let us step through this simple prime-finding program to see how some control flow operations work: <em>(Please don&rsquo;t use this in real code&hellip; there&rsquo;s a <a href="../module/mathinteger.html#prime%3f">better function</a> for this!)</em></p>
<pre><code class="language-phoo">to prime? do
    true temp put
    2
    do
        2dup mod 0 = iff [ false temp replace ] done
        2dup 2 * &gt; if done
        1+ again
    end
    2drop
    temp take
end
</code></pre>
<p>We&rsquo;ll try 7, which is prime. Phoo sees this from the compiler. It starts with the first element:</p>
<pre><code>Currently executing:
[ 7 prime? echo ]
  ^
Stack: []
</code></pre>
<p>This pushes 7 to the stack, and then looks up <code class="language-phoo highlight">prime?</code>. <code class="language-phoo highlight">prime?</code>&lsquo;s definition happens to be a sub-array, so Phoo pushes the array it was in and the pointer to the return stack, and starts back at the first element.</p>
<pre><code>[ 7 prime? echo ]
      ^
Currently executing:
[ true temp put 2 [...] 2drop temp take ]
   ^
Stack: [7]
</code></pre>
<p>After running <code class="language-phoo highlight">true temp put 2</code>, Phoo sees another sub-array and jumps in yet again:</p>
<pre><code>[ 7 prime? echo ]
      ^
[ true temp put 2 [...] 2drop temp take ]
                    ^
Currently executing:
[ 2dup mod 0 = iff [...] done 2dup 2 * &gt; if done 1+ again ]
   ^
Stack: [7, 2]
</code></pre>
<p><code class="language-phoo highlight">2dup mod 0 =</code> tests to see if 7 is divisible by 2, which it is not, so <code class="language-phoo highlight">false</code> winds up on the work stack. Then Phoo sees <code class="language-phoo highlight">iff</code>, looks it up, and gets another sub-array:</p>
<pre><code>[ 7 prime? echo ]
      ^
[ true temp put 2 [...] 2drop temp take ]
                    ^
[ 2dup mod 0 = iff [...] done 2dup 2 * &gt; if done 1+ again ]
                ^
Currently executing:
[ 2 ]cjump[ ]
  ^
Stack: [7, 2, false]
</code></pre>
<p>Now, here&rsquo;s where the magic of the return stack comes into play. <code class="language-phoo highlight">]cjump[</code> takes a number, in this case hard-coded as 2 by <code class="language-phoo highlight">iff</code>, and a truth value. If the value is falsy, it adds the number to the pointer on the return stack. Now, the bottommost pair of array and pointer is not actually on the return stack because it is being used by the Phoo interpreter. So the next-to-last actually gets nudged ahead by 2:</p>
<pre><code>[ 7 prime? echo ]
      ^
[ true temp put 2 [...] 2drop temp take ]
                    ^
[ 2dup mod 0 = iff [...] done 2dup 2 * &gt; if done 1+ again ]
                ~~~~~~~~~~^
Currently executing:
[ 2 ]cjump[ ]
           ^
Stack: [7, 2]
</code></pre>
<p>Now Phoo is at the end of a sub-array and jumps back out to the array on the return stack, incrementing the pointer so it will run the next instruction in the series. But, because <code class="language-phoo highlight">]cjump[</code> had messed with the pointer, it winds up skipping <code class="language-phoo highlight">[...] done</code>:</p>
<pre><code>[ 7 prime? echo ]
      ^
[ true temp put 2 [...] 2drop temp take ]
                    ^
Currently executing:
[ 2dup mod 0 = iff [...] done 2dup 2 * &gt; if done 1+ again ]
                               ^
Stack: [7, 2]
</code></pre>
<p>This is how if statements are implemented.</p>
<p>Continuing, <code class="language-phoo highlight">2dup 2 * &gt;</code> tests if twice 2 (4) is greater than 7, which it is not, so <code class="language-phoo highlight">if</code> skips the <code class="language-phoo highlight">done</code>. (<code class="language-phoo highlight">if</code> is simply defined as <code class="language-phoo highlight">[ 1 ]cjump[ ]</code>.) <code class="language-phoo highlight">1+</code> increments the 2 into a 3, and then Phoo gets to <code class="language-phoo highlight">again</code>:</p>
<pre><code>[ 7 prime? echo ]
      ^
[ true temp put 2 [...] 2drop temp take ]
                    ^
Currently executing:
[ 2dup mod 0 = iff [...] done 2dup 2 * &gt; if done 1+ again ]
                                                      ^
Stack: [7, 3]
</code></pre>
<p><code class="language-phoo highlight">again</code> is defined as <code class="language-phoo highlight">[ ]again[ ]</code>, so Phoo pushes the array to the return stack and runs <code class="language-phoo highlight">]again[</code>:</p>
<pre><code>[ 7 prime? echo ]
      ^
[ true temp put 2 [...] 2drop temp take ]
                    ^
[ 2dup mod 0 = iff [...] done 2dup 2 * &gt; if done 1+ again ]
                                                      ^
Currently executing:
[ ]again[ ]
     ^
Stack: [7, 3]
</code></pre>
<p><code class="language-phoo highlight">]again[</code> unconditionally winds the pointer of the top return stack entry back to -1.</p>
<pre><code>[ 7 prime? echo ]
      ^
[ true temp put 2 [...] 2drop temp take ]
                    ^
[ 2dup mod 0 = iff [...] done 2dup 2 * &gt; if done 1+ again ]
 ^~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Currently executing:
[ ]again[ ]
         ^
Stack: [7, 3]
</code></pre>
<p>When Phoo jumps back put, it finds itself back at the beginning of the loop array, only with 3 on top of the stack instead of 2. 7 is not divisible by 3, nor is 2*3 (6) greater than 7, so the 3 is incremented to 4 and the loop cycles around for a third time.</p>
<p>7 is not divisible by 4 either, but this time 2*4 (8) <em>is</em> greater than 7, so the <code class="language-phoo highlight">done</code> after the second <code class="language-phoo highlight">if</code> is <em>not</em> skipped.</p>
<pre><code>[ 7 prime? echo ]
      ^
[ true temp put 2 [...] 2drop temp take ]
                    ^
Currently executing:
[ 2dup mod 0 = iff [...] done 2dup 2 * &gt; if done 1+ again ]
                                             ^
Stack: [7, 4]
</code></pre>
<p><code class="language-phoo highlight">done</code> is defined as a sub-array, so Phoo jumps in:</p>
<pre><code>[ 7 prime? echo ]
      ^
[ true temp put 2 [...] 2drop temp take ]
                    ^
[ 2dup mod 0 = iff [...] done 2dup 2 * &gt; if done 1+ again ]
                                             ^
Currently executing:
[ ]done[ ]
    ^
Stack: [7, 4]
</code></pre>
<p><code class="language-phoo highlight">]done[</code> simply loses the top return stack entry.</p>
<pre><code>[ 7 prime? echo ]
      ^
[ true temp put 2 [...] 2drop temp take ]
                    ^
Currently executing:
[ ]done[ ]
        ^
Stack: [7, 4]
</code></pre>
<p>When Phoo jumps out, it finds itself out of the loop. <code class="language-phoo highlight">2drop</code> cleans up the 4 and 7, and <code class="language-phoo highlight">temp take</code> retrieves the answer (<code class="language-phoo highlight">true</code>) from the temp stack.</p>
<pre><code>[ 7 prime? echo ]
      ^
Currently executing:
[ true temp put 2 [...] 2drop temp take ]
                                       ^
Stack: [true]
</code></pre>
<p>Phoo jumps back out, <code class="language-phoo highlight">echo</code>es the true, and then exits because the return stack is empty.</p>
<p>Now, what would happen differently if the number was composite, say 8?</p>
<pre><code>[ 8 prime? echo ]
      ^
[ true temp put 2 [...] 2drop temp take ]
                    ^
Currently executing:
[ 2dup mod 0 = iff [...] done 2dup 2 * &gt; if done 1+ again ]
                ^
Stack: [8, 2, true]
</code></pre>
<p>In the case of <code class="language-phoo highlight">true</code>, <code class="language-phoo highlight">]cjump[</code> does nothing, so the <code class="language-phoo highlight">[...] done</code> is run. The <code class="language-phoo highlight">[...]</code> replaces the <code class="language-phoo highlight">true</code> on <code class="language-phoo highlight">temp</code> with <code class="language-phoo highlight">false</code> (look in the definition), indicating the number is not prime, and then the <code class="language-phoo highlight">done</code> exits the loop.</p>
<p>There are a whole lot more meta-control operators than just these, and can be used to make control flow move in weird and confusing ways, so use the meta-words sparingly and only in a way that makes sense.</p>
<p><strong>That&rsquo;s the end of this tutorial for now. I hope to be able to write more.</strong></p>
