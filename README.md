[![build docs](https://github.com/phoo-lang/docs/actions/workflows/build.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/phoo-lang/docs/actions/workflows/build.yml)

Documentation for the Phoo programming language.

All of the `.html` files in `docs/` are automatically generated by `docsgen.py`.

`__header__.html` is a partial file, which is inserted by that script into the header of every page.

The markdown files are also converted into html. `index.md` is special because it will have the list
of all the pages appended after it to serve as a navigation index.
